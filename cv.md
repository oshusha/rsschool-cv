**Hello!**

Thank you for your interest in my resume!

I really love to learn and immediately put new knowledge into practice. I believe that a quality product is always made up of little things. And any big goal always justifies the investment.

My goal is the active development in the profession of a programmer with the prospect of growth to the position of head of the development department in the shortest possible time (within 2-3 years).
In the near future I plan to learn the tools necessary for future work, as well as gain knowledge on the configuration and operation of the web server (nginx, apache) and the basics of the http protocol, and also learn the server programming language (PHP, in the future - Node.js) for solving the necessary tasks. 
In my free time I read literature on algorithms and software architecture.
